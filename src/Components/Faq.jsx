                I have seen some immediate and powerful effects rewarding the work of self-confessed
                unbelievers. Pyramid or PyraVastu is not a form of magic. It works on the scientific
                principles of space and mind, and will have an effect whether or not people can feel it
                or know that it is being used. But if a positive mind and a strong faith is added it can
                give miraculous results.</p>

                I have seen Pyramids have immediate and dramatic effects, but it can also take time.
                Possibly the process is connected to our ability to adapt to change. Pyramids can help
                you get the most from your life. But just as glowing good health needs careful attention
                to diet, exercise and lifestyle, Pyramids will require a little time and care before you
                see dramatic results.</p>

              <p class="mx-2 text-justify">

                Yes, it can definitely be measured. There are many types of tools and
                equipment with me such as Kirlian photography machine, Biosensor equipment and Bio-force
                meter. Also some simple instruments like dowsing pendulum & 'L' and 'Y' rods. But these
                need good experience and knowledge to handle.</p>

                I need not answer this question. Let the results speak. By today more than 2.5 million
                people are connected with this PyraNet and have discovered a new way to health,
                prosperity and power! But do not go by my words, just try out a simple pyramid yantra
                experiment and expect a miracle.</p>

                Hydrogen combined with oxygen is equal to life giving water, in the same manner this new
                method Pyramid Yantra is a powerful combination of pyramids and yantras. This power
                formula has no limitation like that of pyramid and yantra. So it can be placed in the
                pocket or on the wall or also on a vehicle. It can be made more personalized and can be
                placed underground for long duration without corrosion. Also Pyramid Yantra is a pure
                universal science for the common man and can be adapted by all religions or systems.</p>

                  As we are working on a more subtle level, the 'space'- akash-tatva is more important
                  than the material used. Though the most ideal material in which a Pyramid yantra has to
                  be made must be natural, as stone of the Great Pyramid, But we need 91 different
                  chambers of Vastu and practically they cannot be created accurately in stone. So Neutron
                  Polymer is used. You also get the following benefits of the Neutron material:

                <h5>Accurate dimensions - </h5>
                <p class="mx-2">

                  As it is die molded all the
                  dimensions from inside out are the most accurate.
                </p>

                <h5 class="w-25" > Neutral property -</h5>
                <p class="mx-2">
                  It is neutral in property so can be programmed as per your wish. The
                  other metals are affiliated to some property. For example copper is affiliated to Mars,
                  and gold to Sun so results may vary if used in PyraVastu.

                <h5 class="w-50" >Anti-Corrosion & Long lasting -</h5>
                <p class="mx-2">
                  Anti-Corrosion & Long lasting - When we place 9 pyramids under the ground it must stay
                  there for life. In this case this Neutron plastic can stay without corrosion, completely
                  intact in all 91 space chambers for long.

                <h5 class="w-25" >Air tight chambers -</h5>
                <p class="mx-2">
                  Air tight chambers - Each chamber inside a Multier 9x9 is air-tight and it is also a
                  non-porous material.

                Pyramid Yantra are not 'only' yantra but a powerful combination of both pyramid and yantra. They work on advance principles of space and information. Also when we study pyramids, not a single is made of metal. They are either of stone or some non-conducting material only. So whereas traditional yantras can be made in metal but not Pyramid Yantra.</p>

                I personally feel micro is more powerful than gross and mind is more powerful than matter. So you can even get fantastic results by a small PyraChip if you have programmed it adequately with pure love and intense will. But practically speaking numbers do matter. The minimum pyramids you need is a set of 9 Multier (Vastu 9x9) in the center of each building. And minimum of 3 where the defect is to be corrected. But if the defect is in bigger area or intensity, the numbers of Pyramid yantra may increase. The highest number of Multier pyramids used in a single project is 4500 sets, because of huge property and many obstacles.</p>
